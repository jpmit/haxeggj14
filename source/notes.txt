main loop:
see /usr/share/haxe/lib/flixel/.../FlxGame.hx, method onEnterFrame

collisions with tile:
seems like the collide callback is called every time a collision is checked.
separateX and separateY in FlxObject then do the actual collisions with the tilemap!
These call the overlapsWithCallback function in FlxTilemap.hx
**Try registering a callback function with each tile
